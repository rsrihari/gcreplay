Also, once you're out of Kgp, there's no way to connect.\n\nA couple of Kgp alumni are working on a solution. They're building a service called Askabt which combines web forums and instant messaging over the Gtalk network. It lets you post to the forum and get replies instantly on your existing Gtalk account - there's no new software to install.\n\nThey're now looking for beta-testers. If you'd like to help them out and also check out a cool new service, just head over to http://askabt.com/iitkgp click \"Join\", and then accept the friend request on Gtalk. Don't worry - you won't be spammed. If you ever have to unsubscribe, just unfriend \"iitkgp@askabt.com\" from Gtalk.\n\nTo sweeten the pot, they're going to do a quiz on KGP funda in the community - sign up, get questions on Gtalk and be the first to answer to get points. Those with the most points by the end of Feb win Askabt goodies worth up to 10k! If you've noticed, the first to sign up get a distinct advantage - so if you think you have kgp fundae and are online all the time, get started already.\n\nGo to the forum now and register: http://askabt.com/iitkgp",

The inauguration ceremony saw a welcome address by Prof Damodar Acharya, former director of IIT Kharagpur, in which he extolled the young minds to make the most of their time here and spend it cultivating their urge to do something novel. This was followed by the dedication of the Rajendra Mishra School of Entrepreneurship to the nation by Dr. Devendra Mishra and Dr.Amarendra Mishra, who referred to the KGP ambience of group gatherings at places like Chhedis in their elucidation of the importance of the spartan university setting towards nurturing the entrepreneurial streak. In his keynote lecture about his entrepreneurial journey from being a consultant with BCG and a professor, Prof Paul Lillrank of Aalto University, Helsinki, elaborated on his failures and successes. The address by Dr. Hande saw a rapturous round of applause as he, in his discourse about the entrepreneurial ability, elevated the audience to the level of the everyday successes of the ordinary street vendor, from the mundane teachings of the conventional B-schools. The ceremony this evening, with all the wisdom about going the extra mile, into the realm of risk and probability, has very much set the tone for the 3-day summit that is going to see numerous workshops, guest lectures and events aimed at igniting the passion for entrepreneurship and job-creation.",

The City of Joy. It may simply be 'Cal' to most KGPians, but this ancient, beautiful and magical city can be the experience of a lifetime - as Nicole Desouza so brilliantly brings out.
